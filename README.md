Symmetric Encryption Example
============================

Overview
--------

This project demonstrates an experimental symmetric encryption algorithm using custom cryptographic methods. It involves matrix transformations, S-Box substitution, XOR operations, bit-shifting, transposition, and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) to provide secure encryption and decryption mechanisms.

Key Features
------------

-   **Encryption and Decryption**: Utilizes custom transformations and CBC for secure data handling.
-   **Key Evolution**: Dynamic key derivation with SHA-256 hashing for multi-round encryption.
-   **Matrix Operations**: Implements advanced matrix-based transformations for added complexity.

How to Use
----------

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set up a Spring Boot backend and build the project with Docker.
3.  Use the provided API endpoints for encryption (`/api/encrypt`) and decryption (`/api/decrypt`).
