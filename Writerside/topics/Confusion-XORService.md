# Confusion: XORService

Overview
--------

The `XORService` class is a core component in the encryption service. It is responsible for applying the XOR (exclusive OR) operation between the encryption key matrix and the input matrix (bitstream) during encryption and decryption. This operation is performed **X** number of times, where **X** is the number of rounds defined in the key. The XOR operation introduces diffusion in the encryption process by scrambling the data with the key at each round.

```
public class XORService {

    public byte[][][] xorBitstream(byte[][][] bitstreamChunks, KeyMatrix keyMatrix) {
        byte[][][] resultChunks = new byte[bitstreamChunks.length][4][4];
        byte[][] keyMatrixData = keyMatrix.matrix();

        for (int chunk = 0; chunk < bitstreamChunks.length; chunk++) {
            for (int row = 0; row < 4; row++) {
                for (int col = 0; col < 4; col++) {
                    resultChunks[chunk][row][col] = (byte) (bitstreamChunks[chunk][row][col] ^ keyMatrixData[row][col]);
                }
            }
        }

        return resultChunks;
    }
}
```

### Purpose and Role in the Encryption Service

-   **Core Transformation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a critical operation in cryptographic algorithms. It combines the key matrix with the input bitstream (data matrix) to ensure that changes in the key matrix result in substantial changes in the encrypted data.
-   **Multi-round Operation**: The XOR operation is applied multiple times during the encryption process, once for each encryption round, based on the number of rounds embedded in the key.
-   **Data Scrambling**: Each round of XOR transforms the input data matrix using the key matrix, ensuring that even a slight change in the key or data produces a completely different encrypted result.

### Key Concepts

-   **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation between two bits returns `1` if the bits are different and `0` if they are the same. In this service, each byte in the input matrix is XORed with the corresponding byte in the key matrix.
    -   Example:
        -   `10101100 (input byte)`
        -   `01010101 (key byte)`
        -   `XOR Result: 11111001`
-   **Matrix Representation**: Both the key and the input data are represented as 4x4 matrices (16 bytes each). This matrix format allows for straightforward, element-wise transformations using XOR.

### Description

-   **Objective**: Perform an XOR operation between the input bitstream (matrix) and the key matrix to scramble the input data.
-   **Process**:
    1.  **Matrix Setup**:
        -   Both the input (bitstream) and the key are divided into 4x4 byte matrices. The input is often broken into multiple chunks, each represented by a 4x4 matrix.
        -   A result matrix (also 4x4) is created to store the output of the XOR operation for each chunk.
    2.  **XOR Operation**:
        -   For each matrix chunk in the bitstream, the service iterates through the 4x4 matrix and applies the XOR operation between each corresponding element of the input matrix and the key matrix.
        -   Specifically, `result[chunk][row][col] = bitstreamChunks[chunk][row][col] ^ keyMatrixData[row][col]`.
        -   The XOR result is stored in the result matrix, which is returned at the end of the operation.
    3.  **Multi-round Processing**:
        -   After each round of encryption, the key matrix is updated (usually by a hashing operation). The XOR operation is then applied again between the updated key matrix and the input matrix for the next round. This repetition ensures that the encrypted data becomes more secure with each round.

### Example

Let's take an example where the input matrix is:

`Input Matrix (Chunk):
[42,  15,  22,  37]
[60,  128, 90,  44]
[17,  99,  77,  64]
[255, 45,  33,  21]`

And the key matrix is:

`Key Matrix:
[137, 20, 30, 50]
[10,  11, 9,  3]
[60,  10, 33, 22]
[19,  5,  89, 70]`

After performing the XOR operation, the output matrix would be:


`Result Matrix (after XOR):
[179,  31,  8,  23]   // 42 ^ 137 = 179
[50,   139, 83,  47]   // 60 ^ 10 = 50
[45,   109, 44,  86]   // 17 ^ 60 = 45
[236,  40,  120, 83]   // 255 ^ 19 = 236`

This operation is performed element-wise for each row and column of the 4x4 matrix.

### Matrix Operations Explained

-   **Matrix Chunking**:

    -   The input data is split into chunks, where each chunk is a 4x4 matrix. If the data is larger than 16 bytes, it will be divided into multiple 4x4 matrices.
-   **XOR Element-wise**:

    -   For each byte in the input matrix, an XOR is performed with the corresponding byte in the key matrix. This happens element-wise across the 4x4 grid, ensuring that each byte of the input is affected by the key.
-   **Matrix Iteration**:

    -   The function iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix, performing XOR between the corresponding elements from the input matrix (bitstream chunk) and the key matrix.

### Role in the Encryption Workflow

-   **During Encryption**:
    -   After each encryption round, the input matrix is XORed with the current key matrix. This helps to scramble the data in a way that makes it difficult to decrypt without the correct key.
-   **During Decryption**:
    -   The same XOR operation is applied, but this time it reverses the encryption process, using the same sequence of keys to decrypt the data back to its original form.

### Integration in the Encryption Service

-   **Multi-round Encryption**:
    -   The XOR operation is repeated for each round of encryption. The key evolves after each round (via hashing or transformation), so the data undergoes multiple layers of scrambling.
-   **Efficient Scrambling**:
    -   XOR is computationally efficient and helps introduce diffusion in the encrypted data. Even minor changes in the key matrix can lead to vastly different results in the output matrix.
-   **Security**:
    -   The multiple rounds of XOR with evolving keys ensure that the data is effectively obfuscated and cannot be easily recovered without knowing the correct sequence of keys.
